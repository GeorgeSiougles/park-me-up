# A simple CRUD application for managing a parking lot.

I build this project to learn how to manage API calls in NextJS and handle data with MongoDB

* Styled with shadcn/ui and tailwind css
* Database managed my MongoDB

### Hosted by vercel at [park-me-up](https://park-me-up.vercel.app/).

## Running the app
To run the app you need to create a .env.local file and provide a value for the MongoDB connection string called  `MONGODB_URI`. You can get these values by following the documentation on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).

Then run:
``` 
npm install
npm run dev
```

You will be propted to access the site on `localhost:3000/`
